## how to use

for example, you want to read `https://ncode.syosetu.com/n3668ef/200/`.

Here the n3668ef is the novel id, and 200 is the page number.

1. yarn install or npm insall
2. `node index.js [novel id] [min page num] [max page num]`

For example: `node index.js n3668ef 1 10`.

You will get novels of page 1 to 10 in your `./novel` directory.
